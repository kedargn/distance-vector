# distance-vector

Implementation of distance vector routing algorithm. Uses Bellman Ford algorithm to calculate the shortest distance from to sourse node to all destination nodes. "Split horizon" implementation to avoid count-to-infinity problem(split horizon does not mitigate count-to-infinity if there are more than two nodes in a cycle).

To run the program, consult readme.pdf file.
